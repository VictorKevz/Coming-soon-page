# Base Apparel Coming Soon Page

This project is part of the Frontend Mentor challenges. The goal is to build a coming soon page for Base Apparel and make it as close to the design provided by Frontend Mentor as possible.

## Challenge Description

Your challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## Implementation Details

### React Components

#### Header Component

The `Header` component displays the company logo at the top of the page.

#### Form Component

The `Form` component represents the main form section of the coming soon page. It includes an input field for email submission and displays an error message if the email format is invalid or the field is empty.

#### App Component

The `App` component serves as the entry point for the React application, rendering the `Header` and `Form` components.

### Styling

The project's styling is implemented using CSS, with specific styles for different viewport sizes. It includes responsive layouts and hover/focus states for interactive elements.
